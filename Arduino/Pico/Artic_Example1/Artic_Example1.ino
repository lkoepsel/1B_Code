  Using the SparkFun ARGOS ARTIC R2 Breakout & IOTA

  This example begins (initializes) the ARTIC breakout or IOTA. The pin numbers are passed to begin.
  Begin takes care of setting the PWR_EN pins to enable power for the ARTIC and the RF Amp.
  Begin also controls the BOOT pin and downloads the firmware to the ARTIC.
  Begin returns true if the firmware checksum is valid.

  The ARTIC firmware version is read and printed to Serial.

  Hardware Connections:
  This example assumes the ARTIC Breakout has been mounted on a SparkFun Thing Plus - Artemis:
  https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15574
  CS_Pin = A5 (D24)
  GAIN8_Pin = D3
  BOOT_Pin = D4
  INT1_Pin = D5
  INT2_Pin = D6
  RESET_Pin = D7
  ARTIC_PWR_EN_Pin = IOTA_PWR_EN_Pin = D8
  RF_PWR_EN_Pin = D9
  (SPI COPI = D11)
  (SPI CIPO = D12)
  (SPI SCK = D13)

  If you are using the SparkFun ESP32 Thing Plus, the pins are different:
  https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15663
  CS_Pin = A5 (D4)
  GAIN8_Pin = D14
  BOOT_Pin = D32
  INT1_Pin = D15
  INT2_Pin = D33
  RESET_Pin = D27
  ARTIC_PWR_EN_Pin = IOTA_PWR_EN_Pin = D12
  RF_PWR_EN_Pin = D13     ** Please note: D13 on the ESP32 Thing Plus is LED_BUILTIN **
  (SPI COPI = D18)
  (SPI CIPO = D19)
  (SPI SCK = D5)


  If you are using IOTA, uncomment the #define IOTA below.
  IOTA only has one power enable pin. Uncommenting the #define IOTA will let the code run correctly on IOTA.
