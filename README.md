# Engr 1B Makerspace

## Introduction
This repository contains the coding examples used in the Engr 1B Makerspace class. 

## Pico Sketches, Recommended for Use:

### SensorwFilesMenuSerial
Complete program to do the following via the Serial port (USB cable):
```
p - print directory
d - delete a file in the directory
r - record numSamples number of samples with a delaySamples in between each sample
s - show the contents of a sample file 
```
The menu system uses a single character response, so only A-Z/0-9 are available as responses. Program automatically adds *File_* to the name so each file name would be *File_0*, *File_1*, *File_2* or *File_A*, *File_B* and so on.

Once the file contents are printed to the screen, one can use keyboard commands such as Select All (*Cntrl-A/Cmd-A*) and Copy (*Cntrl-C/Cmd-C*) to capture the data to use on the PC.

This program serves as a template only and requires customization to be used as a sensor project. It collects data from pin A0 and converts to a Voltage, however, this is of little value unless you attach a voltage-related object to pin A0.

## Pico Sketches, Partially Complete, Not suitable for Use

### OLED_Display
Code sample to use for projects, demonstrates how to use fonts and display varying lines of text

### SingleFile Drive
This code will allow you to offer a single file to be transferred from the Pico as a USB file, it will show up in the PC's directory as a file

### Adafruit OLED
Simple test the Adafruit 4650 128x64 OLED display.

### DeleteFiles
Demonstrates how to print a directory and delete all the files in the directory.

### folderinfo
Demonstrates how to print statistics as the LittleFS filesystem

### LCD
Simple test for the GEEEKPi LCD Display, display is old technology and the display quality is quite bad.

### lilFS
Demonstration program for using the LittleFS filesystem on the RP2040

### menu
Demonstration for creating a menu program

### seesaw
Test program for using Adafruit Seesaw library for measuring moisture

### SensorEnhanced
Initial sensor program to demonstrate a good technique for reading sensor data

### SensorwFiles
Update to SensorEnhanced to allow for the storage of sensor data

### SensorwFilesMenu
Update to SensorwFiles where a menu is used to guide using the program

### serialRead
Simple program to demonstrate reading sensor data

### SH110_Test
Uses an Adafruit GFX Examples program modified to work with the 128x64 OLED display

## Possible Errors
While attempting to upload code to a Pico, you get this error:
```bash
Error opening serial port '/dev/cu.usbmodem3101'.
```
Be sure to press the Boot/Sel button while plugging in a Pi Pico, or press Reset while holding the Boot/Sel button on the Adafruit Feather. This will put the Pico board in the proper state to accept a new program.
